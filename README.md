# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This is my 1st task for Bharat Intern under the intership program of 'Data Science intern'
This is a typical project that includes making assumptions about numerous characteristics to determine whether a Titanic passenger survived or not.

Project objectives:



To create a basic machine learning model that can forecast Titanic passenger survivability.



1. Gather the Titanic passenger information. 2. Clean up and get the data ready for computer learning. 3. Use the data to train a machine learning model. 4. Assess the model's accuracy. 5. Examine the model's attributes to determine the elements that are most crucial for predicting survival.



Project resources:



1. The Kaggle website has the passenger data from the Titanic. 2. Machine learning will be accomplished using the Python programming language. 3. This Python library is utilized, along with seaborn, pandas, and matplotlib.



Using basic machine learning techniques, one can forecast if the Titanic will survive.
